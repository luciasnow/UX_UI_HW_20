      <div class="jumbotron" id="introBlock">
         <p>This case study goes into detail around my 3 week group project that took place in 2023 redesigning the website of Prairie Protection Colorado, a local nonprofit in Colorado dedicating to the prairie wildlife of the Front Range. <br /> Prairie Protection Colorado (PPC) is a unique organization with a multitude of offerings for users. For this project, we focused on a user who is looking to save their own local colony and pursuing PPC in order to gain support in their cause.</p>

                Our competitor analysis revealed a gap in the market for an approachable but serious organization dedicated to advocating for prairie wildlife. Of the similar sites to PPC, we were inspired by the use of content chunking, hero image, and consistent calls to action. We would need to mesh this with the urgent tone of PPC's work in our design process.</p>

                In our initial interviews, we wanted to evaluate the logical structure of the current Prairie Protection Colorado website, and gather insights on the users' perception and how they identify any nonprofit organization. From their we synthesized our research and created a user persona. We would continue to follow the path of our user River throughout the project.</p>

          <p class="container" id="subheader1">Our research identified a struggle that users experience when trying to learn about or interact with non-profits. Specifically, users found non-profit sites to be cluttered, outdated, and untrustworthy. They were looking for sleek and thoughtful navigation incorporated with user-friendly organization and design.</p>

        <div class="container" id="problem">
            <h1>The Problem</h1>
           <p>Prairie Protection Colorado's website was designed to promote awareness around prairie dog endangerment and allow users to support their cause online. We have observed that users often have trouble finding the information they need and found the unprofessional/sketchy look of the PPC's website off-putting, preventing users from engaging with PPC in meaningful ways like volunteering or working with PPC to save their own local colony. This results in missed opportunities for involvement from potential supportersâ€”leaving the prairie dogs to fend for themselves.</p>
          </div>
    </div>



    <div>
        <h2 id="process">Process</h2>
        <p>Once we had solidified the problem our potential users would be facing when using PPC's website, we started on building the initial prototype for our new design of Prairie Protection Colorado.</p>
        <p>When our initial build was ready for testing, we shared it with users and incorporated a new round of edits into our final iteration.</p>

        <p>As a team we were challenged to balance the many offerings of a non-profit organization within a single website. We focused in on PPC's ability to kickstart a passionate prairie dog lover with the tools they need to fight for justice. This prototype gives a preview of how PPC could better appeal to users through clear, sleek design and a more simplified navigation.</p>
        <p>While we've iterated our prototype into its current form, there is more room for iteration and improvement.</p>
