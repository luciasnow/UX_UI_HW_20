      <div class="jumbotron" id="introBlock">
         <p>This case study goes into detail around my 3 week group project that took place in 2023 redesigning the website of Prairie Protection Colorado, a local nonprofit in Colorado dedicating to the prairie wildlife of the Front Range. <br /> Prairie Protection Colorado (PPC) is a unique organization with a multitude of offerings for users. For this project, we focused on a user who is looking to save their own local colony and pursuing PPC in order to gain support in their cause.</p>

                Our competitor analysis revealed a gap in the market for an approachable but serious organization dedicated to advocating for prairie wildlife. Of the similar sites to PPC, we we inspired by the use of content chunking, hero image, and calls to action.</p>

                In our initial interviews, we wanted to evaluate the logical structure of the current Prairie Protection Colorado website, and gather insights on the users' perception and how they identify any nonprofit organization.</p>

                During our stakeholder interview, with Deanna Meyer Treasurer of PPC, our goal was to find out what PPC need their website to do for them. She revealed a need to find more actionable activists who would the join the fight not only for the prairie dogs, but all wildlife.</p>

          <p class="container" id="subheader1">Our research identified a struggle that users experience when trying to learn about or interact with non-profits. Specifically, users found non-profit sites to be cluttered, outdated, and untrustworthy. They were looking for sleek and thoughtful navigation incorporated with user-friendly organization and design.</p>

        <div class="container" id="problem">
            <h1>The Problem</h1>
           <p>Prairie Protection Colorado's website was designed to promote awareness around prairie dog endangerment and allow users to support their cause online. We have observed that users often have trouble finding the information they need and found the unprofessional/sketchy look of the PPC's website off-putting, preventing users from engaging with PPC in meaningful ways like volunteering or working with PPC to save their own local colony. This results in missed opportunities for involvement from potential supportersâ€”leaving the prairie dogs to fend for themselves.</p>
          </div>

    <div>
        <h2 id="process">Process</h2>
        <p>Once we had solidified the problem our potential users would be facing when using PPC's website, we started on building the initial prototype for our new design of Prairie Protection Colorado.</p>
        <p>When our initial build was ready for testing, we shared it with users and incorporated a new round of edits into our second iteration.</p>

            <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target=".multi-collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="multiCollapseExample1 multiCollapseExample2">Toggle both elements</button>

                <div class="card card-body">
                  Some placeholder content for the first collapse component of this multi-collapse example. This panel is hidden by default but revealed when the user activates the relevant trigger.
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col">

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>As a team we were challenged to balance the many offerings of a non-profit organization within a single website. We focused in on PPC's ability to kickstart a passionate prairie dog lover with the tools they need to fight for justice. This prototype gives a preview of how PPC could better appeal to users through clear, sleek design and a more simplified navigation.</p>
        <p>While we've iterated our prototype into its current form, there is more room for iteration and improvement.</p>
